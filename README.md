# **DFMC: Dead Fuel Moisture Content model**

The model simulates moisture content of dead fuel, with sub-daily resolution and fuel-specific parameters.

This repository provides code and data for the model's definition and calibration process descibed in: 

        Perello et al., "An Hourly Fuel-specific Dead Fuel Moisture Content Model for Wildfire Danger Assessment", Environmental Modelling and Software (submitted)

The model is available in the **DFMC_model** folder, while the calibration procedure, data and results are available in the **calibration** folder.

The *interactive_run.ipynb* notebook contains and example of the model run.
