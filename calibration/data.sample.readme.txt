The dataset MUST be a *pcikle* file

The dataset has to contain a different time series in each row, with the variables in the columns - see *data.sample.pkl*

The following columns are MANDATORY:
* time: pandas.Series containing the time steps [datetime]
* Rain: pandas.Series containing the rain occurred in the time step [mm]
* Temp: pandas.Series containing the temperature [Â°C]
* Wspeed: pandas.Series containing the wind speed [m/s]
* Hum: pandas.Series containing the relative humidity [%]
* DFMC: pandas.Series containing the measured fuel moisture values [%]

NOTE: the fuel moisture values have to be referred to the total wet mass of fuel (see the paper for more details)

The index MUST be identified by *id* and must be unique for each time series.
